EchoForest: The LiDAR Explorer


ðŸŽ® Game Concept:
Youâ€™re navigating through a foggy forest maze, but you canâ€™t see far ahead. Your only tool is a LiDAR scanner that reveals a small circular area around you. As you move, the scanner updatesâ€”mapping out the maze gradually.

Find the exit as soon as you can.
