EchoForest: The LiDAR Explorer


ðŸŽ® Game Concept:
Youâ€™re navigating through a foggy forest maze, but you canâ€™t see far ahead. Your only tool is a LiDAR scanner that reveals a small circular area around you. As you move, the scanner updatesâ€”mapping out the maze gradually.

ðŸ§© Core Mechanics:
Maze in fog: The whole map is covered in fog except the playerâ€™s scan radius.

LiDAR scan radius: Reveals part of the maze as you move (like a light or sonar pulse).

Goal: Find the exit in under 3 minutes. Maze is small (~10x10 tiles).

Minimal interface: Just a dark green forest floor, fog overlay, and faint walls (tree trunks).
